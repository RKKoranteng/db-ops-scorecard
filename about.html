        <h3>How did learn.rk get started?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://rkkoranteng.com" target="_blank">Richard Koranteng</a> launched learn.rk in 2025 after realizing that many of his former students and aspiring DBAs frequently sought his guidance. However, with limited time to mentor each person individually—and not wanting to charge high fees to compensate for his time—he created learn.rk to provide accessible learning opportunities. This platform allows students to learn directly from Richard at no cost.</p>
