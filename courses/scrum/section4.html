      <h3>About CVCS</h3>
      <p>Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) were developed to address limitation of LVCS, mainly collaboration issues. A Centralized Version Control System is a type of VSC where all changes of a project's files are stored on a single central server, meaning every developer accesses and modifies code from that one central repository. This is unlike a LVCS where only one user users has a local copy of the repository with full version history. </p>

      <h3>Pros:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Centralized visibility: All team members can easily see the latest version of the code and track changes made by other.
        </li>
      </ul>
 
      <h3>Cons:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dependency: developer can't access project files if the centralized server is offline</li>
        <li>Data loss risk: The biggest disadvantage is the single point of failure embedded within the centralized server.</li>
      </ul>
