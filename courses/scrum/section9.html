      <h3>What's a sprint retro</h3>
      <p>The sprint retrospective (retro) is a meeting where the scrum team reflects on the recent sprint to identify what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve in the next sprint. Sprint retro differs from a sprint review because it focuses on continuous improvement of the process, rather than reviewing the product itself.</p>

      <h3>When does it occur?</h3>
      <p>The sprint retro occurs at the end of the sprint, after the sprint review. This ceremony should take place before the next sprint begins, allowing the team to identify and implement necessary process improvements.</p>

      <h3>Who is involved?</h3>
      <p>The sprint retro is an internal meeting for the scrum team only.</p>      
      <li><u>1. Product owner:</u> provides insights on product impact and team collaboration.</li>
      <li><u>2. Scrum master:</u> facilitates the meeting, encourages continuous improvement, and ensures follow-through on action items.</li>
      <li><u>3. Developement team:</u> share experiences, identify challenges, and suggest improvements.</li>

      <h3>How long is this meeting</h3>
      <p>The sprint retro meeting is usually 1 hour for a two-week sprint, but it can be longer for bigger sprints.</p>

      <h3>What's the expected outcome of this meeting</h3>
      <p>It provides a safe environment for the team to openly discuss their overall processes.. Here're more details:</p>
        <li>Identified strengths: what went well and should be repeated</li>
        <li>Recognized challenges: what issues or blockers did the team face</li>
        <li>Actionable improvements: specific steps to improve the next sprint</li>
        <li>Commitments for change: The team agrees on what to adjust.</li>
