      <h3>What's Project Management?</h3>
      <p>Inorder to really grasp what Scrum is, we need to first understand project management. Project management is the use of specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver something of value to people. A Project Manager is a person who uses project management methods to manage projects. The two widely recognized general project management methodologies are <b>Waterfall</b> and <b>Agile</b>.</p>

      <h3>Waterfall approach to managing projects</h3>
      <p>The waterfall project management approach entails a clearly defined sequence of execution with project phases that do not advance until a phase receives final approval. The waterfall approach is ideal for projects with fixed requirements, thereby making it a <b>predictive approach</b> to project management.</p>          
      
      <h3>Agile approach to managing projects</h3>
      <p>Agile project management is an iterative approach to managing projects and focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration. As the name implies, Agile methos is deal for projects with changing requirements, thereby making it an <b>adaptive approach</b> to project management</p>

      <h3>What's Scrum?</h3>
      <p>Scrum is a subset/discipline within Agile project management. Scrum helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices inorder to provide value to customers in the shortest amount of time. The term "Scrum" is actually inspired by a scrum in the sport of rugby; in rugby, the team comes together in what they call a scrum to work together to move the ball forward. In this context, Scrum is where the team comes together to move the product forward.</p>

      <h3>What's a scrum sprint?</h3>
      <p>Sprints are at the very heart of scrum. A sprint is a short time period (typically two week period) when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. A scrum sprint is purposely named as such because the product life cycle is broken down into short time periods with an emphasis on speed of completion.</p>
