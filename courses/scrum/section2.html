      <h3>Why are we talking about VCS?</h3>
      <p>Git is a type of Version Control Systems Version Control Systems (VSC). Inorder to understand git we need to first chat about VSC.</p>

      <h3>About VCS:</h3>
      <p>A not-so modern DBA's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they're clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you're in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don't mean to. To deal with this issue, the modern DBA adopted Version Control Systems (VSC) to track all changes made to their files.</p>          

      <p>Like the name implies, a Version Control System (VCS) is a software that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For example, modern DBAs use git to track changes made to database initilization and config files. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead</p>

      <h3>Types of VCS:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Local Version Control System (LVCS)</li>
        <li>Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)</li>
        <li>Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)</li>
      </ul>
