      <h3>Why are we talking Program Management?</h3>
      <p>Inorder to really grasp what Scrum is, we need to first understand project management.</p>
      
      <h3>About Project Management</h3>
      <p>Project management is the use of specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver something of value to people. A Project Manager is a person who uses project management methods to manage projects. IT project managers traditionally used a project management methodology known as 'waterfall' to manage their projects, however this methodology is no longer able to meet the unpredicatble nature of the tech sector. This is where 'agile' project management mentholdoy comes into the picture. Let's get more context between the the two management methodologies commonly found in IT.</p>
