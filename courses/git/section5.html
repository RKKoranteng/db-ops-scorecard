      <h3>About DVCS</h3>
      <p>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) were developed to address limitation of CVCS, mainly dependency on single centralized server. A Distributed Version Control System is a type of VSC that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, with each developer having a local copy of the codebase, including full version history as well. </p>

      <h3>Pros:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Offline work: Developers can work offline and don't need to be connected to a central server to make changes </li>
        <li>Resilience: If the central server fails, the project history is not jeopardized because each developer has a copy.</li>
        <li>Collaboration: Developers can work on different versions of the project simultaneously </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>DVCS have gained popularity because they do not rely on a central server to store all versions of a project's files. This is a big boost for addressing modern technology challenges.</p>
